      "The Turkish, U.S., Ukrainian, and Russian delegations had been set to meet in Istanbul for the first face-to-face discussions since 2022, though no specific timing had been announced as of Thursday evening. Putin had previously proposed direct talks as part of an effort to establish a ceasefire, while the Russian delegation viewed the upcoming negotiations as a continuation of unsuccessful talks from 2022. \n",

Despite ongoing fighting and Russia's territorial gains in eastern Ukraine, there is cautious optimism regarding these upcoming negotiations. UK Defence Minister John Healey called for increased pressure on Putin from Ukraine's allies, suggesting further sanctions to facilitate a return to the negotiation table.\n",
