# üìù AI-Powered Cover Letter Generator

## üîç Overview

The **AI-Powered Cover Letter Generator** is a smart assistant that crafts personalized cover letters based on your resume and a job description scraped directly from a company's official website. It leverages modern **web scraping**, **secure local resume loading**, and **LLM prompt engineering** to automate a task that every job seeker faces.

By focusing on legally accessible data (from company career pages) and keeping your resume data private, this project is both **ethical** and **practical**.
